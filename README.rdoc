== OSWM (open source it with me)

I aim to create a fast and easy to use website for developers and coders to
connect for quick one on one code pairing sessions

VERSION 1:
  Use Case:
    Developer A posts:
      What they want to do (text)
      What languages they want to do it in (A predefined list)
    Developer A must also supply their email address, which is not shown
  
    Developer B comes to the site and wants to pair with Developer A
      Developer B clicks on the post and then has to supply their email address
      Developer A gets an email from the website containing
        Developer B's email address
        A link to destroy their original Post
        A link to auto reply that they are no longer interested in Pairing at this time.
        
    All Posts get destroyed after 30 minutes from their time of creation
      This allowed developers to see only fresh posts, no stale ones.
